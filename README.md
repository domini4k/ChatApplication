Create new user, log in and then pick room you want to use. You can use another incognito tab to log in as a different user, pick the same room and chat with each other.

You can use and change the code as you want. I was using Python 3.7

This is project of chatting application. After user creates account, he can choose the room to enter and chat with others. 
There is useful sidebar where all the user's conversations are listed and can easily be entered by one click.
User can change the room also by clicking bottom button "another room". 
Every message has a timestamp which indicates the time the message has been sent. Also there is author name above every message.

There are few more updates to be made for example: scrolling down on every message sent. Right now I am working on something else.
